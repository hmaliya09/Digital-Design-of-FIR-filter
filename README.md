# Digital-Design-of-FIR-filter
Design and verification of a configurable, parameterized 50th-order low-pass FIR filterâ€”from MATLAB modeling to Verilog RTL implementation and Simulink-based testing using .wav audio files
This project involves the complete design and verification of a configurable and parameterized 50th-order low-pass FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter. The development process begins with MATLAB-based system modeling and progresses through Verilog RTL hardware implementation and simulation. The filter is tested with real audio data (.wav files) in a Simulink environment to validate performance.
